LSP -> Liskov Substitution Principle

Objects of a superclass should be replaceable with objects of a subclass without altering correctness
of the program.


let's suppose we have a bird interface, and it has a fly method but ostrich cant fly so we still have
to implement the method
now in this case ostrich is not a suitable replacement for bird
so LSP is violated

fix -->
we will create a file system
// badCode
A class interface called as file which has 2 methods read and write, and we have a child class of this which
is read only file, but we have to implement write also (should not support write)

File superclass object should be able substituted by child class
solution --> split the large interfaces with smaller ones
