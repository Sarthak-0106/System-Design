Single Responsibility Principle

A class should have only one reason to change, i.e. one responsibility

Eg - A User class should only handle user-related logic

BadCode
let suppose we have an invoice class, and it has some functions like addAmount, getAmount
up to this point its good
but if this also has a function to Send Notifications or save to database than this class has
multiple responsibilities that's not good.

GoodCode
so we create 2 different classes for handling DB operations and email
